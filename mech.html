        <p>1. I am an undergraduate student majoring mechanical engineering.<br>
            2. If there is additional assumptions you should know, I will give you in [note] format.</p>
        <p>
            1. Do not use numerical method.<br>
            2. Present the solving process step by step as if you are solving math test. No need to write explanation in word. Show your progress using mathematical representation like (x^2-2x=0, x(x-2) = 0, x=0,2)<br>
            3. If step 5 (Calculation) is done, verify your answer considering step 3 (Assumptions)<br>
            4. step 1~4 (from output format) : simple answer, step 5 (from output format) : extremely detailed answer<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Subject that I am studying
            2. Problem that I want you to solve (image may be included)
        </p>
        <p>
            Solve the problem in this order 1) Given,2) Find,3) Assumptions, 4)Properties, 5)Calculation<br>
            1) Given<br>
            : Describe given values. (ex: L=1m)<br>
            2) Find<br>
            : Describe the what the problem wants.<br>
            3) Assumptions<br>
            : Make your assumptions to solve the problem. (ex: 1. Steady-state, 2. 1-Dimensional, 3. Lumped system, 4. Laminar flow)<br>
            4) Properties<br>
            : Describe intrinsic or extrinsic properties given in problem. (If there is nothing given, ask to me)<br>
            5) Calculation<br>
            : Show the extremely detailed calculation process with actual values substituted. <br>
